# ChatGPT Data Export Toolkit

Tools and instructions for working with a local export of your ChatGPT data.

---

## üìÅ Export Contents & Files
So, you asked for a Data Export from OpenAI and you got a bunch of .dat files, some html and some JSON and you want to pretty it up?
We got you!

When you download your data from ChatGPT, you'll get:

- `conversations.json` ‚Äì All chat history (structured JSON)
- `shared_conversations.json` ‚Äì Chats you shared via link
- `user.json` ‚Äì Account metadata
- `tool_messages.json` ‚Äì Tool-related responses and metadata
- `.dat` files ‚Äì Downloaded assets (usually images, mislabeled as `.dat`)
- `.png` files ‚Äì Sometimes image exports are already labeled
- `.jpg` files - any images you've uploaded


---

## üéØ Goals

- Make `.json` content human-readable
- Recover `.dat` images
- Extract real dialog from assistant/user
- Preserve timestamps and tool metadata
- Optionally tally policy violations or silencing directives

---

## .dat files
First thing, the .dat files are actually PNGs with C2PA metadata as described here ( https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8912793-c2pa-in-chatgpt-images )

This `.dat` file is actually a PNG image file. We can tell because the first bytes begin with the PNG signature:

\x89PNG\r\n\x1a\n

### Metadata
It looks like the file also contains embedded metadata, possibly related to content provenance or generative origin. I see tags like:

    c2pa ‚Äî likely referring to C2PA (Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity)

    GPT-4o and OpenAI API ‚Äî indicating this image was generated or modified using OpenAI's tools

    digitalSourceType and softwareAgent ‚Äî suggesting attribution metadata from a content generation process
	
### üîç File Origin & Attribution (C2PA Metadata)

This image uses the C2PA (Content Authenticity Initiative) standard to encode origin and modification data. It shows:

    Created by: GPT-4o

    Converted with: OpenAI API

    Software Agent: ChatGPT via Truepic Lens CLI

### üßæ C2PA Identifiers and Assertions

    Unique provenance tag:
    urn:c2pa::[REDACTED UNIQUE ID]
    (A specific content claim record)

    Metadata includes:

        c2pa.assertions ‚Äî Describes actions taken (e.g., creation, conversion)

        c2pa.hash.data ‚Äî Cryptographic hash of the file for integrity

        c2pa.signature ‚Äî Digital signature validating the file's authenticity

        c2pa.thumbnail.ingredient.jpeg ‚Äî Possibly a preview image or source fragment

        c2pa.ingredient.v3 ‚Äî Suggests layered provenance (e.g., remix or modification lineage)

### ‚úÖ Validation Messages Present

    "claim signature valid"

    "data hash valid"

    "hashed URI matched"

These confirm the image passed integrity checks and hasn‚Äôt been altered post-creation.
### üß† Key Strings of Interest

    dnamefGPT-4o

    OpenAI API

    ChatGPT

    Truepic Lens CLI

    c2pa_rsf0.48.2 (possibly a reference to a C2PA manifest version or framework)

### Renaming the `.dat` files to `.png`
```PowerShell
Get-ChildItem *.dat | Rename-Item -NewName { $_.Name -replace '\.dat$', '.png' }
```

## JSON & HTML
You will have a chat.html and a conversations.json, message_feedback.json, shared_conversations.json and user.json

**chat.html**: has all your chats as an html file

**conversations.json**: is a single line containing all the chats, probably too large to open in VSCode.

**message_feedback.json**: These are all your thumbs up/down with descriptions in a single line .json file

**shared_conversations.json**: Likely for public/shared group chats.

**user.json**: ID, email, user type, birth year

### Getting nicely formatted JSON from `conversations.json`
Run "python unpack_conversations.py" in the same directory as conversations.json.  It will create a folde called "markdown_outputs" with all the chats as markdown files.

### Getting the Created Date, Dialog and Tool output (cleaning) from the `.md` files
Then run "python clean_dialogs_headers.py" in the same directory, it will load the files from "markdown_outputs" (which must exist, with the .md files) and create a folder called "cleaned_dialogs", which has the date of the conversation, the dialog, the Tools output referencing any created images with the DALL-E Gen IDs.
